# Tome
A web app for storing artworks

## Synopsis
This is an extension of my winter project where I created a web app that allows authenticated users to upload images and add metadata to them and view those artworks by metadata.

## Project Plan
1. Create the API and database connection for CRUD artwork operations
2. Involve authentication so you can only see your own stuff
3. Hook all of that up to the front-end I created in the last class
4. Add the ability to download .pdfs of tagged artworks
